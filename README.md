# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION


  
## AIM    

 To study the Delta modulation using the Delta Modulation trainer kit. 
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED

Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   

## PROCEDURE
1. Connections are to be given as per the block diagram.
2. Observe the modulated waveforms.
3. Measure the amplitude and time period of both the waveforms.
4. Plot the graph.
